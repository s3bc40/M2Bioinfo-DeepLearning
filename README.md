Project Pytorch Deep Learning fruit 360

- Epochs = 5
- No transfer learning (doesn't work)

1. basic : basic CNN architecture (2 layers, lr = 0.01, without dropout and batch normalization)
2. tuned : tuned CNN architecture (2 layers, lr = 0.001, with dropout and batch normalization)
3. tuned_layer : previous one with another layer
4. finetuning : attempt to transfer learning
